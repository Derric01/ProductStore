### 📁 Folder Structure

```
product-store/
├── backend/     → Express + MongoDB API
└── frontend/    → React + Vite client
```

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-store.git
   cd product-store
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     PORT=5000
     ```

4. **Run the development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both the backend (on port 5000) and frontend (on port 5173).

## 🌐 Deployment Guide

> You can deploy **frontend and backend separately** for best results.

### 🖥️ Frontend (React) – Deploy to **Netlify** or **Vercel**

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
2. Upload the `dist/` folder to Netlify or Vercel.  
3. Set environment variables if needed (e.g., API base URL).

### ⚙️ Backend (Express + MongoDB) – Deploy to **Railway** or **Render**

1. Push your code to GitHub.  
2. Connect your repo on [Railway](https://railway.app).  
3. Add the following environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`
   - `PORT` (optional, default is 5000)
   - `NODE_ENV=production`

4. Use the included `Procfile` and `railway.toml` for deployment configuration.

## 🧪 Sample Product Data

To populate with test data, use the "Add Product" form or create a seeder script in the backend.

---

## ❗ Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB connection error?**
  - Double-check your `.env` file
  - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or your Atlas URI is valid

- **Frontend can't connect to backend?**
  - Confirm the API URL is correct in your frontend config
  - Make sure CORS is enabled in Express backend
